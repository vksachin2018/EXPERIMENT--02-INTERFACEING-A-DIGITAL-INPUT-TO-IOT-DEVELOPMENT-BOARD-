## Aim: To Interface a Digital Input  (IR pair ) to ARM IOT development board and write a  program to obtain  the data 
## Components required: STM32 CUBE IDE, ARM IOT development board,  STM programmer tool.
## Theory 
The full form of an ARM is an advanced reduced instruction set computer (RISC) machine, and it is a 32-bit processor architecture expanded by ARM holdings. The applications of an ARM processor include several microcontrollers as well as processors. The architecture of an ARM processor was licensed by many corporations for designing ARM processor-based SoC products and CPUs. This allows the corporations to manufacture their products using ARM architecture. Likewise, all main semiconductor companies will make ARM-based SOCs such as Samsung, Atmel, TI etc.

 IR technology is used in a wide range of wireless applications which includes remote controls and sensing. The infrared part in the electromagnetic spectrum can be separated into three main regions: near IR, mid-IR & far IR. The wavelengths of these three regions vary based on the application. For the near IR region, the wavelength ranges from 700 nm- 1400 nm, the wavelength of the mid-IR region ranges from 1400 nm – 3000 nm & finally for the far IR region, the wavelength ranges from 3000 nm – 1 mm.The near IR region is used on fiber optic & IR sensors, the mid-IR region is used for heat sensing and the far IR region is used in thermal imaging. The range of frequency for IR is maximum as compared to microwave and minimum than visible light.

## STM 32 CUBE PROGRAM :
```
#include "main.h"
#include "stdio.h"
#include "stdbool.h"
bool IRstatus;
int main(void)
{
  IRstatus = HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_3);

  while (1)
  {
    /* USER CODE END WHILE */
   if (IRstatus == 1){
		  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA,GPIO_PIN_0,GPIO_PIN_RESET);
		  HAL_Delay(1000);
		  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA,GPIO_PIN_0,GPIO_PIN_SET);
		  HAL_Delay(1000);
	  }
	  else{
		  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA,GPIO_PIN_0,GPIO_PIN_RESET);
		  HAL_Delay(1000);
	  }
    /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
  }
  /* USER CODE END 3 */
